Analyzing the posts from r/relationships.

To re-run the analysis get the raw data from [this dropbox folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nkfs3okq0lb58ei/AABc3j7jkFkpPNG_wBfizYyFa?dl=0) and put it in a `/data/raw/` directory in the project folder. Then:
```bash
rscript /absolute/path/reddit_relationships/R/01_clean_data.R
rscript /abasolute/path/reddit_relationships/R/02_analysis.R
```
